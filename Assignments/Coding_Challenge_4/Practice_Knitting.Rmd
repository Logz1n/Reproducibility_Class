```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r Notes}
#you can change the output by changing the order or by doing it in the knit tab
#generating a table of contents toc: true like above (this works best with html format, but works for both)
  #generates clickable links as a toc
  #toc_float has a dropdown button.
#html does not render on github
#to render we have to make the command: md_document:
 # variant: gfm
#output: 
  #md_document:
    #variant: gfm
  #html_document:
    #toc: true
    #toc_float: true
  #word_document:
  #pdf_document:
#Above is a YAML Header
#include/exclude a chunk is include = TRUE/FALSE
#Echo=true it shows output
    
```


This is an example of R code
```{r Example}
# This is R Code
summary(mtcars)
```

This is how to include figures
```{r Include Figures}
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg))+
  geom_point()
```
